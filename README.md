Intelligence 


For the Artificial Intelligence internship, you will need to complete at least 3 tasks for successful completion of the internship.
TASK 1 
CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED 
RESPONSES 
Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.
TASK 2 
TIC-TAC-TOE AI 
Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. 
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.
TASK 3 
IMAGE CAPTIONING 
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a 
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.
TASK 4 
RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 
Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.
TASK 5 
FACE DETECTION AND 
RECOGNITION 
Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
ASK US FOR HELP! THE PURPOSE OF THIS INTERNSHIP IS TO LEARN AND GROW. 
We have no desire to dictate to you. It is entirely up to you whether you seek guidance or not. 
The given tasks may seem very easy or very difficult. We expect you to approach the tasks with professional diligence and give them the attention they deserve."
